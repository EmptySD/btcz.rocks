Wallet Privacy Policy

Scope and Consent
This notice describes the ways BitcoinZ Community collects, store, use and protects a user’s (“User(s),” “you,” or “your”) personal information. The purpose of this notice is to ensure that we comply with applicable United States (US) federal and state regulations, and European Union (EU) data protection laws, and ensures that users are provided privacy protection. 
BitcoinZ Community products include the MyBitcoinZ wallet applications, products, or any other features, technologies or functionalities.

There is one type of user whose personal information we may process:

Users that download and use our Products.
Users accept this Policy by visiting our website and/or by using our Products.

What is “personally identifiable information?”
“Personally identifiable information” (“personal information”) is any information that can be directly associated with a particular person and can be used to identify that person. A prime example of identifiable information is a person’s name. In some instances, such as the EU directive, an email or IP address can be viewed as personal information.

What information we do collect
BitcoinZ Community does not collect users personal information unless the user enables “email notifications.” Once a user selects “Enable email notifications” in the settings section of the product, BitcoinZ Community will store a user’s email address on our servers. If enabled, BitcoinZ Community could have access to view the balance and transaction history of a wallet and link it to a user’s email address. Lastly, BitcoinZ Community always keeps access logs to our servers, which contain IP address, time, access details.

BitcoinZ Community does not collect any third party integrations within the product (such as Bitcoin exchange or any other integrations). It is crucial to note that private keys are never transmitted to our servers, so it is not possible for BitcoinZ Community to access a user’s BitcoinZ in any case.

Entities to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about our products, services, and communications;
law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other legal process or requirement applicable; or when we believe, in our sole discretion, that the disclosure of an email address is necessary to report suspected illegal activity 
Please note that these third parties may be in other countries where the laws on processing personal information may be less stringent than in your country.

Marketing

Changes to this notice
We may amend this notice at any time by posting a revised version on the product’s notice page. The revised version will be effective at the time we post it.
